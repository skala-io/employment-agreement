## Agreement Terms

### Scope of Duties
Employee will perform duties consistent with their Position Title, as listed in the Key Terms, and carry other responsibilities assigned by the Board of Directors (“Board”) that align with their role. Employee will report to the Manager specified in the Key Terms. Employee’s work will be performed at the Location stated in the Key Terms.

### Outside Activities
During employment, Employee will devote the time and effort required by the Commitment section of the Key Terms, excluding Vacation Period and approved leave. Employee may (i) take part in charitable, civic, educational, professional, community, or industry activities; (ii) serve on boards of other organizations with prior written Board approval; (iii) manage their personal and family investments. These activities must not interfere with Employee’s duties or create a business conflict. If the Board, in good faith, determines that a board role conflicts with Employee’s obligations to the Company, Employee must resign from that role promptly. Board positions Employee disclosed before the Effective Date are deemed pre-approved.

### Compensation
Employee will be paid the Base Salary listed in the Key Terms in line with the Company’s payroll schedule. The Company, Board, and/or Manager, as applicable, will review Employee’s salary annually and may increase it but not reduce it. Employee may also be eligible for Additional Compensation as stated in the Key Terms, based on specific goals and performance. Employee may participate in the Company’s benefit plans, subject to eligibility requirements, on terms generally offered to employees in similar positions. If eligible, Employee may also receive the Company’s equity as described in the Key Terms through a vesting-based grant. Any grant will require Board approval and will be subject to the Company’s Equity Incentive Plan and the applicable stock option grant that will set the vesting schedule and other terms.

### Work Schedule and Overtime
Employee’s work schedule will follow the Commitment section of the Key Terms. The Company will comply with applicable overtime laws:  
(i) if Employee is non-exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) or similar laws, Employee will receive overtime pay at the legally required rate for approved hours worked beyond the standard limits;  
(ii) if Employee is exempt from the FLSA or similar laws, Employee is not entitled to overtime pay.  
All overtime must be pre-approved by the Manager. 

### Vacation
Employee is entitled to paid vacation each year in line with Company policy, but not less than the Vacation Period in the Key Terms (prorated for partial years). Employee may take vacation at times of their choice with due regard for the Company’s business needs.

### Business Expenses
Employee will be reimbursed only for reasonable expenses that have been approved in advance in writing by the Company or the Manager and supported by documentation. Employee is solely responsible for, and must maintain adequate records of, business expenses incurred while performing their duties under this Agreement. 

### Mutual Representation
The Company confirms it has properly authorized this Agreement and related benefits, and that it will be binding once signed by Employee. Employee confirms they have the legal right to sign and fulfill this Agreement, and that no other agreements prevent Employee from doing so.

### Term and Termination
This Agreement will terminate on the last day of the Employment Term, unless earlier terminated under this Agreement. It will renew automatically for one-year terms unless the Company gives Employee written notice at least 30 days before the applicable renewal date. Upon termination of employment for any reason, Employee will promptly return to the Company all Company’s property in Employee’s possession or control, including security passes, equipment, and documents and immediately will destroy any copies of such property in any form.

### At-Will Employment
The relationship between Employee and the Company is “at-will.” Both parties can terminate the employment at any time, with or without cause, and with or without advance notice.

### Confidentiality
During the term of this Agreement and afterward Employee shall:  
(i) not use or permit the use of Company’s Confidential Information in any manner or for any purpose not expressly set forth in this Agreement;  
(ii) keep such Confidential Information confidential and protect it from unauthorized use or disclosure; and  
(iii) not disclose such Confidential Information to any third parties except as permitted in this Section 10.  

“Confidential Information” means all information disclosed by Company to Employee, whether before or during the term of this Agreement. This does not include information that is public, lawfully obtained from a third party, or independently developed by Employee without reference to the Company’s Confidential Information. Employee may disclose Confidential Information only to other employees, consultants, and agents who need access to the information to fulfill this Agreement and who are bound by written agreements with confidentiality obligations similar to those in this Section 10.

### No Assignments
This Agreement is personal to both Employee and the Company. Employee may not assign, delegate, or transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the Company’s prior written consent. The Company may assign this Agreement, without Employee’s consent, to any successor that acquires all or substantially all of the Company’s business or assets. Any permitted successor must expressly agree in writing to assume and perform all of the Company’s obligations under this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the Company had continued to be bound.

### Indemnification
Company agrees to indemnify Employee and hold them harmless to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands, judgments, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees), losses, and damages resulting from Employee’s good-faith performance of their duties to the Company.

### Liability Insurance
If eligible, the Company will provide Employee with liability insurance coverage during and after employment, while potential liability exists, on the same terms offered to employees in comparable roles.
